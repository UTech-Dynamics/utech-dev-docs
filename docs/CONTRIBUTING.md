We follow a Conventional Commit–style taxonomy:

feat      – new API behavior
fix       – bug fixes
refactor  – structure only, no behavior change
perf      – performance improvements
db        – schema-level changes
seed      – seed data
chore     – tooling and maintenance

Each commit must have a single primary intent.
----------
| Change type                | Commit type |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Add column for new feature | `feat`      |
| Fix bad schema             | `fix`       |
| Pure optimization (index)  | `perf`      |
| Structural cleanup         | `db`        |

What NOT to do (common mistakes)

❌ Vague:

update code
final changes
improvements


❌ Mixed intent:

feat: add bulk update and refactor controller


→ split commits.
